Battle Tank problem breakdown.

The Battle Tank will operate similar to the Battle City on NES.

During gameplay, the player controls a tank capable of moving up, down, left and
right. The player controlled tank can shoot bullets at a varying rate of fire.
As the player collects power-ups the type of tank changes.

Depending on the type of tank, the rate of fire and the number of hits required
to destroy a tank changes. 

All bullets do the same amount of damage but some bullets are faster than others.

The player shoots enemy tanks. Like the player's tank, enemy tanks vary in type,
durability, rate of fire and speed of bullet. Unlike the player's tank, some 
enemy tanks are faster than others.
